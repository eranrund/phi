Stuff that requires 2+ Cenx4s:
- adding CAN RESET cmd on slaves
- changing knobs from 0-100 to 0-255
- master/slave stuff (rememeber to also update docs)
- CAN fw update

Documentation:
- SysEx protocol
- Bootloader image format
- CAN protocol
- Hardware (Enclosure, pots, BOM, JST cables, USB socket)

Code improvements:
- Ableton needs to be able to read number of modules using SysEx, and configure itself accordingly
- Add CAN command set both pot val and text at same time

Misc:
- Create landing page. Should include:
  - Logo
  - Pictures of Cenx4
  - List of features
  - Waiting list for 1/2/3/4 module configurations
  - Link to blog
- Open the github repository (BLOCKING: need landing page)
- Obtain VID/PID through pidcodes (BLOCKING: need landing page + gh repo)
