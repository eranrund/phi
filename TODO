Stuff that requires 2+ Cenx4s:
- changing knobs from 0-100 to 0-255

Documentation:
- SysEx protocol
- Bootloader image format
- CAN protocol
- Hardware (Enclosure, pots, BOM, JST cables, USB socket)

Code improvements:
- Ableton needs to be able to read number of modules using SysEx, and configure itself accordingly
- Add CAN command set both pot val and text at same time
- Change hw_sw ver to 32 bit (hw 8 bit, sw 24 bit)
- Change display commands to have one SET instead of SET_STATE and SET_DISPMODE
- create an init app on master
   - checks versions of available modules and update if possible
   - when done, starts setup app (or maybe straight to ableton if config is ok?)

Web:
 - Update bootloader CAN commands
 - update to 32 hw_sw ver
 - make setup dialog poll/refresh available midi ports

Misc:
- Open the github repository (BLOCKING: need landing page)
- Obtain VID/PID through pidcodes (BLOCKING: need landing page + gh repo)
