narvi:
 - Bootloaderize the app, create bootloader tree
 - Look at GPIOB_OTG_HS_VBUS not being alternate in board.h
- Also at GPIOB_OTG_HS_ID ?
- GPIOA_TIM2_ETR ?
- bl need massive cleanup including usbcfg.c, maybe without audio? bl over midi?
- bl + app need rnd number generator init
- CAN
- USB MIDI bootloading...


- move headphones button one to the left, so that its available in all modes (normal/browser/cue)
- when entering browser auto-uncue all and start preview mode, when exiting restore
- always stop preview mode when exiting browser
- start preview mode when entering browser
- restart preview mode when selected track changes
- after a track is selected maybe enter cue mode?



at45 multiimg stuff:
 - Improve reporting to PC over midi (send progress messages via midi). This should also clean up error handling
   in the update slaves code inside the init app
 - test init app with an empty config, should switch to ableton and then to setup
 - add reserved bytes to bl headers, multiimg headers


Hyperion:
- main/bl need rnd init code

Documentation:
- SysEx protocol
- Bootloader image format
- CAN protocol
- Hardware (Enclosure, pots, BOM, JST cables, USB socket)

Cenx4:
 - slave bootloading through master midi
 - Traktor app needs module mapping similar to the ableton app


Misc:
 - Convert all tabs to spaces, cleanup all the whitespace mess :(
 - Think about refactoring module mapping code because it's a mess
